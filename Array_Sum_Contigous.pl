#Given an array of integers, return true if there are contiguous numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
#
#For eg: [6,1,2,3,3,7] target sum is 8, will return true because 2,3,3 adds up to 8 and are contiguous.
#
#[6,1,2,4,3,3,7] will return false as there are no contiguous elements which adds up to 8.
